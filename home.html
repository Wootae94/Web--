                                <strong>WEB이란 무엇인가?</strong></a></h3>
                        <hr>
                        <p><strong>The World Wide Web </strong>, commonly known as the Web, is an information system where documents
                            and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs, such as https://example.com/)
                            ,which may be interlinked by hypertext, and are accessible over the Internet.
                            The resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
                            and may be accessed by users by a software application called a web browser and are
                            published by a software application called a web server.
                            The World Wide Web is not synonymous with the Internet, which pre-existed the Web in some
                            form by over two decades and upon whose technologies the Web is built.</p>
                        <p> English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989.
                            He wrote the first web browser in 1990 while employed at CERN near Geneva, Switzerland.
                            The browser was released outside CERN to other research institutions starting in January
                            1991, and then
                            to the general public in August 1991.
                            The World Wide Web has been central to the development of the Information Age,
                            and is the primary tool billions of people use to interact on the Internet.</p>
                        <p>Web resources may be any type of downloaded media, but web pages are hypertext documents
                            formatted in
                            Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).
                            Special HTML syntax displays embedded hyperlinks with URLs which permits users to navigate
                            to other web
                            resources.
                            In addition to text, web pages may contain references to images, video, audio, and software
                            components
                            which are either displayed or internally executed in the user's web browser to render pages
                            or streams
                            of multimedia content.</p>
                        <p> Multiple web resources with a common theme and usually a common domain name, make up a
                            website.
                            Websites are stored in computers that are running a web server, which is a program that
                            responds to
                            requests made over the Internet
                            from web browsers running on a user's computer. Website content can be provided by a
                            publisher, or
                            interactively from user-generated content.
                            Websites are provided for a myriad of informative, entertainment, commercial, and
                            governmental reasons.

                        <strong>HyperText Markup Language(HTML) </strong>
                        is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.<br>
                        It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server 
                        or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.
                        <p>HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.                            </p>
                        <p> HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms 
                            may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics 
                            for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.
                            HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.</p>

                        <p><strong>Style Sheets (CSS)</strong>
                        is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup
                        language like HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>
                        <p>
                        This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control
                        in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting
                        by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the
                        structural content as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that
                        share the file and its formatting.</p>
                    <p>Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different
                        styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based
                        tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.</p>
                    <p> The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies
                        if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.
                        CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.

                                <strong>JavaScript란 무엇인가?</strong></a></h3>
                        <hr>
                        <p><strong>JavaScript</strong> is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.
                            JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm.
                            It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class
                            functions.</p>
                        <p> Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.
                            JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications.
                            The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page behavior,and all major web browsers have a
                            dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.</p>
                        <p> As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming
                            styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions,
                            standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM). However, the language itself does not include any input/output
                            (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, as the host environment (usually a web browser) provides those APIs.</p>
                        <p> JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but they are now embedded in some servers,
                            usually via Node.js. They are also embedded in a variety of applications created with frameworks such as Electron and
                            Cordova. Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name, syntax,
                            and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.</p>
